\chapter{Site requirements}

\section{Sensor requirements}
The site for the sensor should be chosen with regard to the following
requirements (highest priority given first).

\begin{itemize}
\item Within range of the base unit.
\item Away from moving metal objects, for example, trains (more than
  \SI{50}{\metre}), cars (more than \SI{20}{\metre}).
\item Away from static metal objects, in particular those containing
  the \emph{ferro-magnetic} materials iron, nickel and cobalt.
\end{itemize}

\section{Network requirements}

The following network requirements are needed for the system to
operate fully:
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain name system (DNS) resolution. This is normally provided
  as standard on most networks.
\item Outgoing access on port 123 (NTP).
\item Outgoing SSH access (port 22).
\end{itemize}
