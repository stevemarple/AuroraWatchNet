\chapter{Site requirements}

\section{Sensor requirements}
The site for the sensor should be chosen with regard to the following
requirements (highest priority given first).

\begin{itemize}
\item Within range of the base unit.
\item Away from moving metal objects, for example, trains (more than
  \SI{50}{\metre}), cars (more than \SI{20}{\metre}).
\item Away from static metal objects, in particular those containing
  the \emph{ferro-magnetic} materials iron, nickel and cobalt.
\end{itemize}

The FLC100 fluxgate magnetometer sensor is slightly sensitive to
temperature variations. To ensure correct behaviour a stabilised
temperature environment is required. This is obtained by burying the
sensor.

\section{Network requirements}

The following network requirements are needed for the system to
operate fully:
\begin{itemize}
\item \dns\ resolution. This is normally provided
  as standard on most networks.
\item Outgoing access on port 80 (\http) and 443 (\https). Required
  for software updates.
\item Outgoing access on port 123 (\ntp), or access to a local \ntp\
  server.
\item Outgoing \ssh\ access (port 22).
\end{itemize}
