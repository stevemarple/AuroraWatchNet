The site should be chosen with regard to the following requirements
(highest priority given first).

\begin{itemize}
\item Within range of the base unit.
\item Away from moving metal objects, for example, trains (more than
  \SI{50}{\metre}), cars (more than \SI{20}{\metre}).
\item Away from static metal objects, in particular those containing
  the \emph{ferro-magnetic} materials iron, nickel and cobalt.
\end{itemize}
