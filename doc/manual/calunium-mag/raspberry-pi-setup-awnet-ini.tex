If the magnetometer is to use the Ciseco XRF radio modules to
communicate between the sensor unit and base unit then as user
\rootUser
\begin{Cmd}[fontsize=\relsize{-1.75}]
cp \mytilde{}pi/AuroraWatchNet/software/server/ini_files/calunium_xrf_awnet.ini /etc/awnet.ini
nano /etc/awnet.ini
\end{Cmd}
\todo[Add support for serial and USB versions.]

If the magnetometer is to use Ethernet to communicate between the
sensor unit and base unit then first identify which Ethernet shield is in use.

If using the original Arduino Ethernet shield, which is fitted with
the WIZnet W5100 Ethernet controller, then as user \rootUser
\begin{Cmd}[fontsize=\relsize{-1.75}]
cp \mytilde{}pi/AuroraWatchNet/software/server/ini_files/calunium_w5100_awnet.ini /etc/awnet.ini
nano /etc/awnet.ini
\end{Cmd}

If using the later Arduino Ethernet shield 2, which is fitted with
the WIZnet W5500 Ethernet controller, then as user \rootUser
\begin{Cmd}[fontsize=\relsize{-1.75}]
cp \mytilde{}pi/AuroraWatchNet/software/server/ini_files/calunium_w5500_awnet.ini /etc/awnet.ini
nano /etc/awnet.ini
\end{Cmd}
