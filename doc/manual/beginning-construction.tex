\section{Order of assembly}

For ease of access components should normally be fitted in order of
increasing size, particularly increasing height. It is also preferable
that \emph{passive} components (resistors, capacitors, inductors and
crystals) are fitted before semiconductors (field-effect transistors,
integreated circuits). This is because the semiconductors are easily
damaged by electro-static discharge (sometimes this damage isn't
immediately obvious). It is therefore more convenient to fit as many
components as possible before fitting the semiconductors, at which
point ESD precautions should be followed. As field-effect transistors
are particularly vulnerable to damage by ESD it is recommended they
are fitted as late as possible.
From these guidelines the
following order is recommended.
\begin{itemize}
\item Surface-mount passive components.
\item Surface-mount semiconductors.
\item Through-hole passive components.
\item Through-hole semiconductors (FETs last).
\item Switches.
\item Connectors, battery holders.
\end{itemize}
