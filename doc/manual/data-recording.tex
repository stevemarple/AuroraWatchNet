\chapter{Data recording and transfer}

\section{Introduction}

Data is recorded on the Raspberry Pi using a \emph{daemon}
process, which is started and stopped by the Debian init scripts. The
recording process saves the data as daily files, whose locations are
determined by the \filename{/etc/awnet.ini} configuration file. Data
transfer is initiated at regular intervals using a \filename{cron} job
(see section~\ref{sec:cron-configuration}) to call \filename{rsync}.
